# Internet Downtime Recorder
A python script to keep track of how much time your internet connection is down over time. The script creates a file called "data.csv" and records the times the connection goes down and comes back up.

### Usage
Place `record_internet_outages.py` in whatever folder you'd like on your machine. 

Open the command line in the directory where the script is located and run `python record_internet_outages.py`. 

Any time the connection drops, the script will write the time the connection went down and when it comes back up into a file called `data.csv`. This file is created whatever folder the script is contained in.
